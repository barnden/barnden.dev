## Higher Order Functions
A function is considered to be higher-order if it takes a function as an argument or returns a funciton as a result.

```haskell
twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)
```

- Common programming idioms can be encoded as afunctions
- Domain specific languages can be defined as collections of higher-order functions (e.g. for processing lists)
- Algebraic properties of higher-order functions can be used to reason about programs

## map
- map applies a function to every element of a list

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

> map (+1) [1,3,5,7]
[2,4,6,8]
```

## filter
- filter selects every element from a list that satisfies a predicate

```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

> filter even [1..10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
```

- filter can be defined using a list comprehension

```haskell
filter p xs = [x | xs <- xs, p x]
```

- alternatively, through recursion

```haskell
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x       = x : filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs
```

## foldr
- many functions can be defined using a simple pattern of recursion, which can then be expressed as folding to the right.

```haskell
f [] = v -- v is base value
f (x:xs) = x # f xs ]
    -- any non-empty list to some function # to its head, and f of its tail
-- any empty list gets mapped to v
```

- sum
    ```haskell
    sum [] = 0
    sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs

    sum = foldr (+) 0
    ```
- product
    ```haskell
    product [] = 1
    product (x:xs) = x * product xs

    product = foldr (*) 1
    ```
- and
    ```haskell
    and [] = True
    and (x:xs) = x && and xs

    and = foldr (&&) True
    ```

foldr can be defined using recursion

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f v [] = v
foldr f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr f v xs)
```

However, it could help to think of folder as replacing every cons operator in a list with the given function, and the empty list with the base value.

The length function can also be defined in terms of `foldr`.

```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
```

```haskell
length = foldr (\_ n -> 1+n) 0
```

Also, the reverse function

```haskell
reverse [] = []
reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]
```

```haskell
reverse = foldr (\x xs -> xs ++ [x]) []
```

### Why is foldr useful?
- Some recursive functions on lists are simpler to define using foldr
- Properties of functions defined using foldr can be proved using the algebraic properties of foldr
- Advanced optimizations can be simpler if foldr is used in place of explicit recursion

## foldl
`foldl` folds from the left rather than to the right.

## Other Library Functions

### `(.)`
The library function `(.)` returns the composition of two functions as a single function

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
f . g = \x -> f (g x)
```

For example,

```haskell
odd :: Int -> Bool
odd = not . even
```

### `all`
`all` decides if every element of a list satisfies a given predicate

```haskell
all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
all p xs = and [p x | x <- xs]

> all even [2,4,6,8]
True
```

### `any`
`any` decide if at least one element of a list satisfies a predicate``

```haskell
any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
any p xs = or [p x | x <- xs]

> any isSpace "abc def"
True
```

### `takeWhile`
`takeWhile` selects elements from a list while a predicate holds all of the elements.

```haskell
takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile p [] = []
takeWhile p (x:xs)
    | p x       = x : takeWhile p xs
    | otherwise = []


> takeWhile isAlpha "abc def"
"abc"
```

### `dropWhile`
`dropWhile` removes elements while a predicate holds all of the elements.

```haskell
dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile p [] = []
dropWhile p (x:xs)
    | p x       = dropWhile p xs
    | otherwise = x:xs

> dropWhile isSpace "    abc"
"abc"
```

## filter, map, foldr

```haskell
sumOfSquaresOfPos ls
    = foldr (+) 0 (map (^2) (filter (>= 0) ls))

keepPos = filter(>= 0)
mapSquare = map(^2)
sum = foldr (+) 0
sumOfSquaresOfPos ls = sum (mapSquare (keepPos ls))

sumOfSquaresOfPos = sum . mapSquare . keepPos
```
