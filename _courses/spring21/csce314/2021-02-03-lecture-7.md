## Conditional Expressions
Functions can be defined using conditional exprs.

```haskell
if cond then e1 else e2
```

- `e1` and `e2` must be the same type
- `else` branch always present

```haskell
abs :: Int -> Int
abs n = if n >= 0 then n else -n

max :: Int -> Int -> Int
max x y = if x < = y then y else x

take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
take n xs = if n <= then []
            else if xs == [] then []
                else (head xs) : take (n - 1) (tail xs)
```

## Guarded Equations
As an alternative to conditionals, funcs. can be def. using guarded equations.

```haskell
abs n | n >= 0    = n
      | otherwise = -n
```
- Otherwise always evaluates to True, used for default case

```haskell
signum n | n < 0     = -1
         | n == 0    = 0
         | otherwise = 1

signup = if n < 0 then -1 else
            if n == 0 then 0 else 1
```

- Guards and patterns can be mixed freely

```haskell
take  :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
take n _  | n <= 0 = []
take _ []          = []
take n (x:xs)      = x : take (n-1) xs
```

## Pattern Matching
Many functions are defined using pattern matching,

```haskell
not      :: Bool -> Bool
not False = True
not True  = False
```
<figcaption>not maps F to T, and T to F</figcaption>
- Pattern can be const. or incl. one or more vars.

Functions can often be defined in many different ways using pattern matching,

```haskell
(&&)            :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True && True    :: True
True && False   :: False
False && True   :: False
False && False  :: False
```

can be defined more compactly,

```haskell
True && True = True
_    && _    = False
```

However, the following definition is more efficient because it avoids evaluating the second argument,

```haskell
False && _ = False
True  && b = b
```

Patterns are matched in order, and may not repeat variables.

## List Patterns
Internally, every non-empty list is constructed by repeated use of the cons operator. Functions on lists with at least one element can be defined using `x:xs` patterns.

```haskell
head        :: [a] -> a
head (x:_)   = x

tail        :: [a] -> [a]
tail (_:xs) :: xs
```

- `x:xs` only match non-empty lists
- `x:xs` must be parenthesized, the function application has operator over the colon operator.
- Patterns can contian arbitrarily deep structure

## Totality of Functions
- (Total) function maps every element in the function's domain to an element in its codomain.
- Partial function maps zero or more elements in the domain to an element in its codomain, some elements undefined.

## λ-Expressions
Anonymous functions can be constructed using λ.
```haskell
\x -> x+x
```

- The symbol λ is lambda, typed using `\`
- Nameless functions typlically defined using \\(\mapsto\\) symbol
- λ symbol comes from λ-calculus, of which the theory of functions that Haskell is based on

### Why are λ-exprs. Useful?
1. λ-exprs. can be used to give a formal meaning to f unctions defined using currying

    ```haskell
    add x y = x + y
    square x = x * x
    -- means the same as
    add = \x -> (\y -> x + y)
    square = \x -> x * x
    ```

2. λ-exprs. can be used to avoid naming functions that are only referenced once.

    ```haskell
    odds n = map f [0..n-1]
        where
                f x = x * 2 + 1
    -- simplifies to
    odds n = map (\x -> x * 2 + 1) [0..n-1]
    ```

3. λ-exprs. can be bound to a name (function argument)

    ```haskell
    incrementer = \x -> x + 1
    add (incrementer 5) 6
    ```

## Case Expressions
Pattern matching need not be tied to func. defs., they work with case exprs.

```haskell
tame m ys = case (m, ys) of
            (n, _) | n <= 0 -> []
            (_, [])         -> []
            (n, x:xs)       -> x : take(m-1) xs
```

```haskell
length [] = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
```

using a case expr. and λ

```haskell
length = \ls -> case ls of
                    [] -> 0
                    (_:xs) -> 1 + length xs
```

## Let and Where
The let and where clauses are used to create a local scope within a function
```haskell
-- using let
reserved s =
    let keywords = words "if then else for while"
        relops = words "== !=  < > <= >="
        elemInAny w [] = False
        elemInAny w (l:ls) = w `elem` l || elemInAny w ls
    in elemInAny s [keywords, relops]

-- using where
reserved s =
    elemInAny s [keywords, relops]
    where keywords = words "if then else for while"
        ...
        elemInAny w (l:ls) = w `elem` l || elemInAny w ls
```

### Let vs. Where
The let/in is an expr., whereas where blocks are decl. bound to the func. context.

## Operator Sections
An operator written between its two arguments can be converted into a curried function written before its arguments,

```haskell
1 + 2
(+) 1 2
```

### Why are sections useful?
Useful functions can sometimes be constructed in a simple way using sections.

- `(x)` - addition function `(\x -> (\y -> x + y))`
- `(1+)` - successor function `(\y -> 1 + y)`
- `(1/)` - reciprocation function `(\y -> 1 / y)`
- `(*2)` - doubling function `(\x -> x * 2)`
- `(/2)` - halving function `(\x -> x / 2)`

## List Comprehensions
- Set comprehension can be used to construct new sets from old sets, e.g.
    $$
    \left\{\left(x^2, y^2\right) | x \in \{1,2,...,10\}, y \in \{1,2,...,10\}, x^2 + y^2 \leq 101\right\}
    $$
- Haskell equivalent:
    ```haskell
    [(x^2, y^2) | x <- [1..10], y <- [1..10], x^2 + y^2 <= 101]
    ```

### Generators
- The expr. `x <- [1..10]` is called a generator
- Comprehensions can have multiple generators, comma delimited
- Multiple generators are like nested loops

### Dependent Generators
Later generators can depend on the variables introduced by earlier generators

```haskell
[(x, y) | x <- [1..3], y <- [x..3]]
```

Using a dependent generator, we can define the library function that concatenates a list of lists:

```haskell
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat xss :: [x | xs <- xss, x <- xs]
```

## Guards
List comprehensions can use guards to restrict the values produced by earlier generators

```haskell
[x | x <- [1..10], even x]
```

Example: Using a guard, create a func. that maps pos. int. to its list of factors:

```haskell
factors :: Int -> [Int]
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]
```

## Zip Function
Zip maps two lists to a list of pairs of their corresponding elements

```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
```

Using zip, we can define a function that returns the list of all positions of a value in a list:

```haskell
positions :: Eq a => a [a] -> [int]
positions x xs = [i | (x', i) <- zip xs [0..n], x == x']
                    where n = length xs - 1
```

Using zip to create all pairs

```haskell
pairs :: [a] -> [(a,a)]
pairs xs = zip xs (tail xs)
```

Using pairs, we cand efine a function that decides if elements in a list are sorted

```haskell
sorted :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
sorted xs = and [x <= y | (x,y) <- pairs xs]
```

## Recursion
Many functions can be defined in terms of other functions

```haskell
-- iterative
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial n = product [1..n]
-- recursive
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Recursive definition diverges on integers less than 0, because the base case is never reached.

### Why is recursion useful?
- Some functions are simpler to define in terms of other functions
- Many functions are naturally defined in terms of themselves
- Recursion can be proved using induction

### Recurison on Lists
Lists have a naturally recursive structure. Consequently, recursion is used to define functions on lists

```haskell
product :: [Int] -> Int
product [] = 1
product (n:ns) = n * product ns
```

Using the same pattern of recursion as in a product we can define the length function on lists

```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
```

Using a similar pattern of recursion, we can define the reverse function on lists

```haskell
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse [] = []
reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]
```

## Multiple Arguments
- Zipping the elements of two lists
- Remove the first n elements from a list
- Appending two lists

## Laziness Revisted

```haskell
numberList xs = zip [0..] xs

> numberList "abcd"
[[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c'), (3, 'd')]]
```
