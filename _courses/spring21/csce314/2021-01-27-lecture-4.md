## Types

A **type** is a collection of related values, every well-formed expr. has a type, which can be determined a compile time through type inference.

Terminology:
- **Type error** - applying a function to arguments of the wrong type.
- **Type annotation** - the syntax `e :: T` is states expr. `e` has type of `T`.

Basic Types:
- **Bool** - logical
- **Char** - single characters
- **String** - char list
- **Int** - fixed-precision ints
- **Integer** - arbitrary-precision integers
- **Float** - single-precision floating-point
- **Double** - double-precision floating-point

## Lists

A **list** is a sequence of values of the same type.

Note:
- [t] is a list with elements of type `t`
- Lists can be infinite

## Tuples

A **tuple** is a sequence of values of different types.

Note:
- (\\(t_1, t_2, \dots, t_n\\)) is the type of n-tuples whose \\(i\\)<sup>th</sup> component has type \\(t_i\\) for any i in 1..n.
- The type of a tuple encodes its size
- The type f the components is unrestricted
- Tuples with arity one are not supported, i.e. (t) is parsed as t, parentheses ignored.
