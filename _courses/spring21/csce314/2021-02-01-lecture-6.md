## Polymorphic Functions

A function is **polymorphic** if its type contains one or more type variables.


```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
```
For any type `a`, `length` takes a list of values of type `a` and returns an integer (`a` is a type variable).

```haskell
id :: a -> a
```
`id` maps a variable of type `a` to an output of type `a`.

```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
```

## Polymorphic Types

Type variables can be instantiated to different types in different circumstances.

```haskell
> length [False, True]
2
> length [1,2,3,4::Int]
4
```

| expression | polymorphic type | type variable bindings | resulting type |
| -         | -             | -                     | - |
| id        | a -> a        | a = Int               | Int -> Int
| id        | a -> a        | a = Bool              | Bool -> Bool
| length    | [a] -> Int    | a = Char              | [Char] -> Int
| fst       | (a, b) -> a   | a = Char, b = Bool    | Char
| snd       | (a, b) -> b   | a = Char, b = Bool    | Bool
| ([], [])  | ([a], [b])    | a = Char, b = Bool    | ([Char], [Bool])

Type variables must beginw ith a lower-case letter, and are usually named a, b, c, etc.

## Overloaded Functions

A polymorphic function is overloaded if its type contains one or more class constraints.

```haskell
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
-- for any numeric type a, sum takes a list of values of type a
--    and returns a value of type a.
```

Constrained type variables can be isntantiated to any types that satisfy the constraints:
```haskell
> sum [1,2,3] -- a = Int
6
> sum [.1,.2,.3] -- a = Float
.6
> sum ['a', 'b', 'c'] -- Char is not numeric
ERROR
```

## Class Constraints

Recall that polymorphic types can be instantiated with all types, e.g.,

```haskell
id :: t -> t        length :: [t] -> Int
-- This is when no operation is subjected to values of type t
```

What are the types of these functions?

```haskell
min :: Ord a => a -> a -> a
min x y = if x < y then x else y
    -- type variables can only be bound
    --  to types that satisfy the constraints
elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> bool
elem x (y:ys) | x == y = True
elem x (y:ys) | elem x ys
elem x [] = False
```

`Ord a` and `Eq a` are **class constraints**.

## Type Classes
Constraints arise because values of a generic type are subjected to operations that are not defined for all types.
```haskell
min :: Ord a => a -> a -> a
min x y = if x < y then x else y

elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
elem x (y:ys) | x == y = True
elem x (y:ys) | = elem x ys
elem x [] = False
```

Ord and Eq are **type classes**:
- Num (numeric types)
- Eq (equality types)
- Ord (ordered types)

```haskell
(+)     :: Num a => a -> a -> a
(==)    :: Eq a  => a -> a -> Bool
(<)     :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
```

## Eq and Ord Classes
```haskell
class Eq a where
    (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    x /= y = not (x == y)
    x == y = not (x /= y)

class (Eq a) => Ord a where
    compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
    (<), (<=), (>=), (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
    max, min :: a -> a -> a

    compare x y | x == y = EQ
                | x <= y = LT
                | otherwise = GT
```

## Enum Class
```haskell
class Enum a where
    toEnum      :: Int -> a
    fromEnum    :: a -> Int
    succ, pred  :: a -> a
    ...
```

Minimal complete definition: `toEnum`, `fromEnum`

**Note**: these methods only make sense for types that map injectively into Int using `fromEnum` and `toEnum`

```haskell
succ = toEnum . (+1) . fromEnum
pred = toEnum . (subtract 1) . fromEnum
```

## Show and Read Classes
```haskell
class Show a where
    show :: a -> String
class Read a where
    read :: String -> a
```
Many types are showable and/or readable.
```haskell
> show 10
"10"
> show 10
"[1,2,3]"

> read "10" :: Int
10
> read "[1,2,3]" :: [Int]
[1,2,3]
> map (* 2.0) (read "[1,2]")
[2,4]
```
