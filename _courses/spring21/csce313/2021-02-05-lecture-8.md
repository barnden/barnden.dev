## Process Definition
- A process is an instance of a running program. This happens through its **abstraction**
  - "A program in action"
  - An "instance" of a program is much like how an object is an instance of a class in OOP languages
  - Provided by the OS and used by the program
- To the OS, the process is a data structure (and more)
  - Used to save programs' states
  - A program can be kicked out and restored

## Process Data Structures
The process is represented by the Process Control Block (PCB). The OS can kickout a process and bring it back due to the PCB.

The PCB can be represented as:

## Internal OS Tables
- An OS keeps information in the main memory
  - Resources (devices, memory state)
  - Running programs/processes
- Note that program data is not the same as PCB
  - PCB is the process' metadata
  - Programs' data (variables, allocated memory) and code are kept in the process image (i.e. address space), which is separate and usually bigger in footprint

## Abstraction Mechanism
- Process provides each program with two key abstractions
  - Logical control flow for CPU virtualization
    - Each program seems to have exclusive use of the CPU
  - Private address space for memory virtualization
    - Each program seems to have exclusive use of the main memory
- How are they maintained?
  - Process executions are interleaved (multiprogramming and timesharing)
  - Private address spaces are managed by the virtual memory system

## Logical Control Flow using Context Switching

</div>

## Address Space
- A program's data can be divided into different parts; therefore, they are loaded as groups into memory

| user stack |
| run-time heap (managed by new/malloc) |
| read/write segment (e.g. global vars) |
| read-only segment (e.g. code, const. variables) |
