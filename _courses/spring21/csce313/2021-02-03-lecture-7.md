## Safe Mode Transfer - Interrupt Handling
- First, User -> Kernel concept is simple
  - Store state of the process
  - Execute the handler
  - Return to interrupted process by restoring saved state
- Actual implementation is more complicated
  - We must know which information must be stored
    - Basically, the *entire* program/process state

### Saving Process State

In the above, just before the CPU was going to execute line 5000, an interrupt occurs. It should goto the kernel and execute the handler, however, it must return to the program after finishing, so what is important to store?

The program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP) address, EFLAGS, and register contents must be stored in order for the CPU to resume execution, the data is packaged as the process content block (PCB).

The above handler attempts to save the data required for the PCB before handling the interrupt, however, it will not work. By going into the handler, we have changed our PC to 100 (when trying to use the save PC function). Similarly, the stack pointer will also be changed. Therefore, saving the PCB data through software does not work as the act of saving overwrites the data that needs to be saved.

- The processor only has 1 set of the SP/PC/EFLAGS etc.
- Any piece of code has a unique PC position, and requires its own SP to be loaded into the CPU
- Switching from user to handler code **requires** the data to be overwritten

- Therefore, we must use hardware logic to save the data, as it will be able to read the values without modifying them

Returning to the graphic, if an interrupt occurs right before execution of instruction 5000, the CPU will then disable any further interrupts, and save the PC/SP/EFLAGS etc. into the kernel interrupt stack (KIS), then the handler will then execute `pushad` to store the general-purpose registers (GPRs). We store the GPRs via software because they are not necessarily required for code execution, some handlers do not modify the GPRs so they do not save them in the first place. 

## User to Interrupt Handler Mechanism on x86
- Hardware does the following
  1. Mask further interrupts
    - they are stored, not thrown away
    - because interrupts are disabled (stored), the cpu can provide concurrency safety
  2. Change to kernel-mode
    - How do we change to kernel-mode while in user-mode?
      - There is no code that does this for obvious security reasons, the switch is done entirely in hardware.
  3. Copy PCB to the KIS
  4. Change SP to the KIS
  5. Change PC: invoke the interrupt handler from the interrupt vector table (IVT), i.e. overwrite PC with handler PC
- Software (handler code)
    1. Stores the rest of the GPRs being used by the interrupted process
    2. Does the rest of the interrupt handling operation

**Note**: In reality, the CPU does not have a special register for the KIS, the SP gets stored in a special register then the SP register turns into the KIS.

When the handler ends
- The handler code restores the saved GPRs (optional)
- Hardware restores the PCB, reenables interrupts, switch to user-mode

## Sequential vs Nested Interrupt
- In x86, other interrupts are disabled to avoid confusion
  - This keeps things simple, however, no levels of priority among interrupts
- Therefore, many systems support nested interrupt handlers
