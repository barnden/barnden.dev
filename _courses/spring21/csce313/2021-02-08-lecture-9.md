## Mapping from Virtual to Physical Memory

We can map contiguous virtual space to a non-contiguous physical space through the page table.

If the main memory does not have enough space, then it gets mapped to the swap (page) file.

Because the page table is bijective, it can get quite large if every virtual address is mapped to physical, so we only store what is used. There is a page table for each process, and is encoded in the virtual memory itself.

The private address space of a process is made up of pages
- These pages can be spread out arbitrarily
- Contiguous memory blocks in processes' view need not be contiguous in physical memory, they can be *stitched* together

Each memory access is actually 2 memory access: one for page table, one for actual memory access.

## Process States
- Assume that the processes A, B, C are located in memory
- PC points to physical address of the instruction to be executed
  - Do not consider virtual address for simplicity

PC: 8000
