## Running Another Program from a C/C++ program
Sps. we run `exec("name", arglist)` where `name` is the name of the other program's name. Kernel loads the `name` executable program from disk into the process, then copies `arglist` into the process, then calls `main(argslist)` of the `name` program. The current process gets dumped, and replaced with `name`; we do not come back to the original process.

```cpp
int main() {
    char*args[] = {"ls", "-lash", NULL};
    std::cout << "--- BEFORE ---\n";
    execvp(args[0], args);
    std::cout << "--- AFTER ---\n"; // will not execute
}
```

## Avoiding Image Overwrite
In most cases, we do not want to overwrite our process; instead we can create a new process by `fork`ing. The original program becomes the parent, and other process becomes the child. The parent and child run in parallel and independently, by default `fork` creates an identical copy of the original.

## Creating New Processes
```cpp
int main() {
    std::cout << "[START] PID: " << std::getpid()
        << " PPID: " << getppid() << '\n';

    pid_t pid = fork();

    std::cout << "[END] PID: " << std::getpid()
        << " PPID: " << getppid() << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```
```
[START] PID: 3108, PPID: 3101
[END] PID: 3108, PPID: 3101
[END] PID: 3109, PPID: 3108
```

## Controlling `fork`ed Processes
In most cases, we want different behavior from the child than from the parent.
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int ret = fork();

    if (ret)
        printf("Parent\nPID: %d, CHILD PID: %d", getpid(), ret);
    else
        printf("Child\nPID: %d, NO CHILD", getpid());
}
```

Note: the return value from `fork()` can be negative in case of failure, a check against this should be done in practice.

## Coordinating Processes
