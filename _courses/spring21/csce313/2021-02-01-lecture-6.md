## Architectural Support
- OSes mediate between apps and hardware
- A modern OS cannot run on hardware that does not support it, i.e. hardware *must* be modified to accommodate OS functions

## Architectural Features
- Protection Modes
  - Protection Ring, User/Kernel modes
  - Privileged Instructions
- Interrupts and Exceptions
- Syscalls
- Timers (clock)
- Memory Protection
- I/O Control and Operation
- Synchronizaiton Primitives (i.e. atomics)

## Dual-mode Execution
- Every CPU has 2 modes of execution (CPU alternates between modes)
  - **Kernel-mode**: execution with **full privileges** of hardware
  - **User-mode**: execution with **limited privileges**
    - only granted by the OS kernel

- Only the OS should be able to
  - Directly access I/O
    - Allows OS to enforce security and fairness
    - User programs are greedy
  - Manipulate memory management state
    - Page tabes (virtual -> physical), protection bits, TLB entries
    - Processes use them, but cannot modify
  - Adjust protected control registers
    - User <-> kernel mode, raise/lower interrupt level
  - Execute CLF Instruction

## CPU Models

## Memory Protection
Because of virt. mem. no process can harm another, however, it is still important to enforce memory protection.

The kernel is mapped into the lower part of each process' address space in order to load an run the process, handle interrupts, exceptions, syscalls, etc. therefore, the kernel must be protected from a faulty or malicious actor.

Read only kernel memory is a possible solution (cannot overwrite essential processes)
  - Cannot work because kernel can contain sensitive data that should not be able to be read, e.g. page tables
  - Without restricting what can be read, this method is useless for security

A primitive but effective solution:
- A **base** and **bound** register for each process
- Cannot access (r/w) anything below base
- The check is only done in user mode (kernel has unlimited access)

## Hardware Timer
- OS timer is a critical building block
  - Many resources are time-shared, e.g. the CPU
  - Allows OS to prevent infinite loops
- Fallback mechanism by which OS regains control
  - When timer expires, generate interrupt
  - Handled by kernel, which controls resumption context
    - Basis for **OS scheduler**
  - Setting (and clearing) a timer is a privleged inst.


## Mode Switch
- Mode separation does **not** mean that a user program cannot request a Kernel-mode Operation
  - User mode to kernel mode switch is very common
  - We must switch from one mode to another such that protection is not compromised

### User -> Kernel Mode Switch
- Interrupts
- (Sync) Exceptions (Faults and Aborts)
- Syscalls (traps, protected procedure call)

### Kernel -> User Mode Switch
- New process/new thread start
  - Jump to first inst. in program
- Return from interrupt, exception, syscall
  - Resume suspended execution
- Process/thread context switch
  - Resume some other process
