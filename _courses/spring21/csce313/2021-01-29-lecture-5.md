## Altering the Control Flow
- CPU executes 1 instruction at a time, mostly sequentially
- Program-assisted mechanisms are able to change the control flow
  - **Jumps and branches** react to changes in program state
  - **Function call and return** using stack discipline react to program state

Those are insufficient for a useful system:
  - The user application is central -- it must give up control for the OS (making it unresponsive)
  - It is difficult for the CPU to react to other changes in system state, i.e.
    - Data from NIC
    - Division by zero
    - React to SIGINT from user
- System needs mechanisms for "**exception control flow**"

## Exception Control Flow

- An exception is a transfer of control to the OS in response to some event, "asynchronous" behavior also arises from this.

## Async Exceptions (Interrupts)
- Caused by events **external** to processor (i.e. outside of current program)
  - Indicated by setting processor interrupt pins
  - Handler returns to "next" instruction after handling
- Examples:
  - I/O -- keyboard/mouse, network packet, disk
  - Hard-reset -- reset button
  - Soft-reset -- CTRL + ALT + DEL on Windows

## Interrupt Vectors
- Each type of event has a unique exception number, k
- Index into jump table (interrupt vector)
- Jump table entry k points to a function (exception handler)
- Handler k is called each time exception k occurs

## Synchronous Exceptions: Traps, Faults, Aborts
- Caused as a result of executing an instruction
- Types:
  - syscalls
  - faults
  - aborts

# System Calls
- Functions called by user programs to interact with the OS
- Syscalls must be executed in some privileged mode so it can access OS data
  - Example: opening files requires finding a file (reading), or creating a file (writing)
- However, it must also act like a regular function that returns a file descriptor if successful.

### Mechanism of System Calls
The program stack has the following structure, with decreasing addresses
- Kernel Stack
- Stack/Stack Pointer (SP)
- Shared Libraries
- Heap
- Data
- Code

Looking at this stack:
- The user stack maintains a collection of stack frames, however, a malicious actor can modify the SP and navigate through the frames (e.g. gdb is able to do so for debugging).
- The solution is to keep OS data inside a restricted kernel stack
  - (IA32/AMD64) The syscall code is placed in `%rax` register, (0 for read, 1, for write, 2 for open, 3 for close)
  - The CPU issues a trap (software interrupt), which invokes a handler in privileged move
  - The interrupt handler makes a frame in the kernel stack, places its return value in `%rax` then calls `iretq` (not `retq`) to return from interrupt handler and revert to user mode
    - Value of `%rax` is put in place of return value

### Control Flow of System Calls

User Program (up)
```cpp
foo() {
    open("test", "rw")
}
```
User Stub (us)
```cpp
open (arg1, arg2) {
    %rax = SYSOPEN(=2)
    trap
    copy %rax to stack
    retq
}
```
Kernel Stub (ks)
```
open_handler_stub() {
    1. Copy args from user memory
    2. Validate args
    3. callq open_handler(arg1, arg2)
    4. put return value into %rax
    5. iretq return
}
```
Kernel (kr)
```cpp
open_handler(arg1, arg2) {
    // perform file open operation
}
```

1. `(up)` The user program requests to access to `test` file.
2. `(us)` Set `%rax` to `SYSOPEN(=2)`, and trap
3. `(ks)` Copies and validates  user args, then issues `callq` instruction to `(kr)`
4. `(kr)` Performs file open operation and sends output back to `(ks)`
5. `(ks)` Output from `(kr)` stored to `%rax`, then issues `iretq` to return to `(us)`
6. `(us)` Copies value from `%rax` to stack, then issues `retq` to return to (`up)`
7. `(up)` Can now read/write to file from user space

## Faults
- Unintentional, but possibly recoverable (e.g. page fault)
- Either re-executes the faulting instruction, or aborts

</div>

{% example %}
Memory Reference

- User writes to mem location
- The page not mapped yet
- Page handler must load page into main memory
- Returns to faulting instruction
- Tries again, and should be successful
{% endexample %}

{% example %}
Illegal Memory Reference

- User writes to mem location
- Address not valid
- Page handler detects invalid address
- Sends `SIGSEGV` to user process
- User process exits with segfault
{% endexample %}

## Aborts
- Unintentional, and unrecoverable
  - parity error, machine check, divide by zero
- Aborts current program and hands control to the OS
  - This allows the OS to put essential error checking
  - The OS becomes more robust when applications are failing or crashing (applications do not hang)

## Summarizing Control Flow Exceptions

- User programs are **not** in charge of handling every exception
- Mechanism is not used exclusively for error handling (page faults for caching/allocation)
- Synchronous/Internal (trap, fault, abort), or Async/External (I/O interrupt, hard or soft reset, etc.)
