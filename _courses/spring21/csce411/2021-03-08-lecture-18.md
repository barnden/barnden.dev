## Connected Components

{% definition %}
Connected Component

If $$G$$ is an undirected graph, then the connected component of $$G$$ is a maximal subgraph that is connected.
{% enddefinition %}

```cpp
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray; CC[v] = cc#;
2.  for (each edge [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white) DFS(w);
3.  color[v] = black

main()
1.  for (each vertex v) color[v] = white;
2.  cc# = 0;
3.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white)
            cc# = cc# + 1; DFS(v);
4.  output(CC[1..n])
```

The time complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$.

## DFS on Directed Graphs

The adjacency matrix of a directed graph has a value of $$a_{i,j} = 1$$ if $$[i, j]$$ is an arc in the graph; 0 otherwise. For a weighted graph, $$a_{i,j} = w_{i,j}$$ is the weight of the arc $$[i, j]$$.

The adjacency list of a directed graph $$G = (V, E)$$ is an array $$\text{Adj}[1..\|V\|]$$ of lists, where $$\text{Adj}[v]$$ is a list of all arcs from v.

For graphs with $$n$$ nodes and $$m$$ arcs, adjacency matrices take $$\Theta(n^2)$$ space and adjacency list takes $$\Theta(m)$$ space.

Checking if $$[v, w]$$ is an arc:
Matrix: $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time.
List: $$\mathcal{O}(\text{deg}(v))$$ time.

Traversing all arcs from a vertex $$v$$:
Matrix: $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$ time.
List: $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time.

### Algorithm
```cpp
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray;
2.  for (each arc [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white) DFS(w);
3.  color[v] = black;

main()
1.  for (each vertex v)
        color[v] = white;
2.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white) DFS(v);
```

Runtime: $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$

## Topological Sorting
Given a directed graph $$G$$, order the vertices of G into an array $$T[1..n]$$ such that if $$[T[i], T[j]]$$ is an arc, then $$i < j$$, or report no such order exists.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray;
2.  for (each arc [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white) DFS(w);
        else if (color[w] == gray)
            Stop("No topological order")
3.  color[v] = black; T[t] = v; t = t - 1;

TopSort() // T[1..n] is output array
1.  for (each vertex v)
        color[v] = white;
2.  t = n;
3.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white) DFS(v)
```

Runtime: $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$
