## MST
Let G be a weighted graph. A spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G that is a tree and contains all vertices of G. The weight of a spanning tree T is the sum of weights of edges in T.

## MST Problem
Given a weighted and undirected graph G, construct a minimum spanning tree of G, i.e., a spanning tree of G whose weight is the smallest over all spanning trees of G.

### Dijkstra's Approach
Idea: Starting from any vertex s, grow a tree using the lightest edges.

```cpp
Prim(G)
1.  for (v = 1; v <= n; v++)
        status[v] = unseen;
2.  s = V[0]; status[s] = in tree;
3.  for (each edge [s, w])
        status[w] = fringe; parent[w] = s;
        WEIGHT[w] = wt(s, w);
4.  while (there are fringes)
4.1     pick fringe v of minium weight[v]
4.2     status[v] = in tree
4.3     for (each edge[v, w])
4.3.1       if (status[w] == unseen)
                status[w] = fringe; parent[w] = v;

```
