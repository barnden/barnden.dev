## Depth First Search

Starting from a vertex $$s$$, explore the graph vertices as far as possible before back tracking.

One implementation of DFS is to replace the queue data structure from BFS with a stack.

1. DFS gives a DFS-tree
2. The two ends of an edge not in the DFS-tree are always ancestor and descendant (back-edges)
3. All edges are either tree edges or back-edges.

### Pseudocode (Recursive Version)
```cpp
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray;
2.  for (each edge [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white)
            DFS(w)
3.  color[v] = black;

main()
1.  for (each vertex v)
        color[v] = white;
2.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white)
            DFS(v)
```

### Running Time
The runtime for DFS is $$\mathcal{O}(m + n)$$.
1. DFS(v) is called on each vertex exactly once.
2. Charge the time of DFS(v) to the vertex $$v$$, not including the recursive calls DFS(w) in DFS(v).
3. This runtime is considered to be optimal.
