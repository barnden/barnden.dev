## Definitions

{% definition %}
Undirected Graph

An undirected graph G is a pair \\((V, E)\\), where \\(V\\) is a finite set of points called vertices, and E is a finite set of edges. Each edge \\(e \in E\\) is an unordered pair \\([u, v]\\) of vertices.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Directed Graph

An edge (or arc) \\(e\\) is an ordered pair \\([u, v]\\) of vertices, where \\(v\\) is the head and \\(u\\) is the tail of the edge.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Path

A **path** \\(P(v_0, v_k)\\) from a vertex \\(v_0\\) to a vertex \\(v_k\\) is a sequence \\(\{v_0, v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\}\\) of vertices, where \\([v_{i-1}, v_i]\\) are edges in \\(G\\) for \\(i = 1,2,\dots,k\\). The path \\(P(v_0, v_k)\\) is a cycle if \\(v_0 = v_k\\). The path \\(P(v_0, v_k)\\) is **simple** if all vertices are distinct. The **length** of a path is defined as the number of edges in the path.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Connected Graphs

An undirected graph is connected iff every pair of vertices is connected by a path.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Tree

A tree is connected acyclic graph. A tree of \\(n\\) vertices has \\(n - 1\\) edges.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Forests

A forest is a acyclic graph (i.e., a graph without simple cycles). Or a collection of trees.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Weighted Graph

A graph that has weights associated with each edge is called a weighted graph.
{% enddefinition %}

## Graph Representations

{% definition %}
Adjacency Matrix

The adjacency matrix of a graph has a value \\(a_{i,j} = 1\\) if vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) shares an edge, and 0 otherwise. For a weighted graph, \\(a_{i,j} = w_{i,j}\\), the weight of the edge.
{% enddefinition %}

{% definition %}
Adjacency List

The adjacency list of a graph \\(G = (V, E)\\) is an array \\(Adj[1..|V|]\\) of lists, where \\(Adj[v]\\) is a list of all vertices adjacent to vertex \\(v\\).
{% enddefinition %}

For graphs with \\(n\\) nodes, and \\(m\\) edges, adjacency matrices take \\(\Theta(n^2)\\) space and adjacency list takes \\(\Theta(m)\\) space.

Check if \\([v, w]\\) is an edge:
Adjacency Matrix: \\(\mathcal{O}(1)\\) time
Adjacency List: \\(\mathcal{O}(\text{deg}(v))\\) time

Traversing all edges on a vertex \\(v\\):
Adjacency Matrix: \\(\mathcal{O}(n)\\) time
Adjacency List: \\(\mathcal{O}(1)\\) time
