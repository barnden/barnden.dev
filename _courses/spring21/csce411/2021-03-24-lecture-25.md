## Single-Source Shortest Path Problem
1.  If the graph has no negative edges, then apply Dijkstra's algorithm, which takes time no more than $$\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$$ and $$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$$
2.  If the grpah is undirected and has negative edges that are reachable from $$s$$, then the problem has no meaningful solutions.
> All conditions in 1 and 2 are easily detected.
3.  If the graph is directed and has negative edges, then apply the Bellman-Ford algorithm that runs in time $$\mathcal{O}(nm)$$

## All Pairs Shortest Paths Problem
Problem. Given a (possibly negatively) weighted graph $$G$$, find the shortest path from $$s \to t$$ for all vertex pairs $$(s, t)$$.

First Solution: For each vertex $$s$$, call Bellman-Ford to find the shortest paths from $$s$$ to all other vertices. Time: $$\mathcal{O}(n^2m) = \mathcal{O}(n^4)$$
- In order to do so adjacency matrices
- For each $$k$$ defined an $$n \times n$$ matrix $$M^{(k)} = [d\_{ij}^{(k)}]_{1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n}$$, where $$d\_{ij}^{(k)}$$ = the length of the shortest path from $$i \to j$$ that uses only vertices in $$\{1, \dots, k\}$$ for its internal vertices.
- $$M = M^{(0)}, M^{(n)}$$ = the matrix for all-pairs shortest paths.
- We can compute $$M^{(k)}$$ from $$M^{(k - 1)}$$,$$
d\_{ij}^{(k)} = \min\left\\{ d\_{ij}^{(k - 1)}, d\_{ik}^{(k - 1)} + d\_{kj}^{(k - 1)}\right\\}
$$

## Floyd-Warshall
Problem. Given a (possibly negatively) weighted graph $$G$$ in an adjacency matrix $$M$$, find the shortest path from $$s \to t$$ for all vertex pairs $$(s, t)$$.

```cpp
FloydWarshall(M)
1.  M^(0) = M
2.  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++)
        // compute M^k = [d_(ij)^(k)] from M^(k-1)
2.1     for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
2.2         for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
                if (d_(ij)^(k-1) < d_(ijk^(k-1) + d_(kj)^(k-1))
                    d_(ij)^(k) = d_(ij)^(k-1);
                else
                    d_(ij)^(k) = d_(ik)^(k-1) + d_(kj)^(k-1)
3.  return the matrix M^(n)
```

The matrix only gives the length of the shortest path for each vertex pair. How do we get the actual shortest path for each vertex pair?

Use another group of matrices $$P^{(k)} = \left[p_{ij}^{(k)}\right]$$, where $$p_{ij}^{(k)}$$ is the vertex right before $$j$$ on the shortest path from $$i \to j$$ for the matrix $$M^{(k)}$$.

### Complexity
Theorem. FloydWarshall solves the APSPP in time $$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$$ and space $$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$$.

### Modified Algorithm to find Paths
The original algorithm only found the distance, but in order to find the path:
```cpp
FloydWarshall(M)
1.  M^(0) = M; initialize P^(0); // M^(0) = [d_(ij)^(0)]
2.  for (k = 1; k <= n; k++)
        // compute M^k = [d_(ij)^(k)] from M^(k-1)
2.1     for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
2.2         for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
                if (d_(ij)^(k-1) < d_(ijk^(k-1) + d_(kj)^(k-1))
                    d_(ij)^(k) = d_(ij)^(k-1);
                    p_(ij)^(k) = p_(ij)^(k-1);
                else
                    d_(ij)^(k) = d_(ik)^(k-1) + d_(kj)^(k-1)
                    p_(ij)^(k) = p_(kj)^(k-1)
3.  return the matrix M^(n)
```

### Negative Cycles
If a vertex $$v$$ is in a negative cycle, then $$M^(n)[v,v] <  0$$.
