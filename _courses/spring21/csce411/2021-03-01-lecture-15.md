## BFS

Starting from a vertex `s`, traverse the graph vertices "level by level".

- BFS gives a BFS-tree.
- The two ends of an edge not in the BFS-tree is either in the same level or in adjacent level.
- BFS is used to find the shortest path between two vertices (add another array to record the parent of each vertsx in the BFS-tree)
- BFS is used to test connectivity of a graph
- BFS is used to test bipartiteness of a graph

### Pseudo Code
```cpp
BFS(G, s) // Q is a queue
1.  for (vertex v in G) color[v] = white; // O(n)
2.  color[s] = grey; // O(1)
3.  Q <- s; // Push s into queue
4.  while (Q not empty) // O(n + m)
        w <- Q; // Dequeue into w
        for (edge [w, v]) // O(m)
            if (color[v] == white)
                color[v] = gray;
                Q <- v; // Enqueue v
        color[w] = black;
```

### Running Time

Assuming adjacency list, the run time of BFS is \\(\mathcal{O}(m + n)\\), where \\(m\\) is number of vertices and \\(n\\) the number of edges.
1. Each vertex is enqueued once and dequeued once.
2. Each vertex, each edge incident to \\(v\\) is examined only once. So the for-loop is executed \\(2m\\) times.
