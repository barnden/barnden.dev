## Single-Source Shortest Path Problem

(Valid for both directed and undirected graphs)

Problem: Given a weighted graph G and two vertices $$s$$ and $$t$$ in $$G$$, find shortest path from $$s$$ to $$t$$ in $$G$$.

The **weight** of a path $$P$$ is equal to the sum of the edge weight over all edges in $$P$$.

Dijkstra's Idea: Start from vertex $$s$$, gradually grow a tree $$T$$, rooted at $$s$$, by adding the vertex that currently "looks" the best.

### Questions
1. How do we record $$T_s$$?
   - Give vertices status "in-tree" and remember their parent.
2. How do we know which vertex is addable?
   - Give vertices status "fringe" and remember their "parent" in $$T_s$$.
3. How do we find the best addable vertex?
   - Record verices' current distance from $$s$$ in the tree $$T_s$$.

- status[1..n]: The status of vertices
- parent[1..n]: The parent of vertices
- dist[1..n]: The distance of vertices from $$s$$

```cpp
Dijkstra(G, s, t)                       // O(n^2)
1.  for (each vertex v)                 // O(n)
        status[v] = unseen;
2.  status[s] = in_tree;                // O(1)
    dist[s] = 0;
3.  for (each edge [s, w])              // O(n)
        status[w] = fringe;
        dist[w] = weight(s, w);
        parent[w] = s;
4.  while (there exists fringes)        // < n times
4.1     v = fringe with min dist;       // O(n)
4.2     status[v] = in tree;            // O(1)
4.3     for (each edge [v, w])          // O(n)
4.3.1       if (status[w] == unseen)    // O(1)
                status[w] = fringe;
                parent[w] = v;
                dist[w] = dist[v] + weight(v, w);
4.3.2       else if (                   // O(1)
                status[w] == fringe &&
                dist[w] > dist[v] + weight(v, w)
            )   parent[w] = v;
                dist[w] = dist[v] + weight(v, w);
5.  output parent[1..n];
```
