## Kruskal's Approach
Idea: Repeatedly add the lightest edges to make a connected and acyclic graph that covers all vertices (i.e., a spanning tree).

```cpp
Kruskal(G)
1.  sort edges in nondecreasing order
        e_1, e_2, ..., e_m
2.  T = empty graph
3.  for (i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        e_i = [u_i, v_i];
        if (T + e_i has no cycle)
            T = T + e;
4.  return T
```

### Questions:
1.  How do we represent T such that we can test efficiently if $$T + e_i$$ contains a cycle?
    - DFS could be used, however, it is not efficient enough (although it is good due to linear time)
    - Because T is acyclic, a component of T is a tree. Thus, adding an edge to the same component makes a cycle while adding an edge connecting two different components does not make a cycle. Thus, for the edge to be added, we only need to check if its two ends are in the same component.
        - We represent each component of T in a tree structure, so that we can test if the two ends of an edge are in the component.
        - We use an array to represent these trees, one entry for each vertex. The index corresponds with the vertex, and the value of the entry at that index represents the vertex's parent.

2.  How do we check if two vertices $$u, v$$ are in the same tree?
    - For each pair $$u, v$$, find root of the tree:
    ```cpp
    Find(w)
    1.  y = w;
    2.  while(p[y] <> 0) y = p[y];
    3.  return y;
    ```
    They are in same tree if `Find(u) == Find(v)`
    - How do we add an edge to connect two trees?
    ```cpp
    Union(r1, r2)
    // r1 and r2 are tree roots
    1.  p[r1] = r2;
    ```

### Full Algorithm
```cpp
Kruskal(G)
1.  sort edges in nondecreasing order
        e_1, e_2, ..., e_m
2.  T = empty graph
    for (each vertex v)
        MakeSet(v);
3.  for (i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        e_i = [u_i, v_i];
        r_1 = Find(u_i), r_2 = Find(v_i);
        if (r1 <> r2)
            Union(r1, r2);
            T = T + e;
4.  return T
```

Where `MakeSet(v)` is `p[v] = 0`.


### Complexity
Time complexity for step 1 is $$\mathcal{O}(m\log n)$$, for step 3 $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$.
For step 4, the loop iterates $$m$$ times, then `Find(w)` requires some improvements:

`Find(w)` is faster with shorter trees, therefore, we must modify our `Union(r1, r2)` in order to keep the trees as short as possible.
To do so, we add a rank[1..n] array to record height of trees.

Change the following:
```cpp
MakeSet(v)
p[v] = 0;
rank[v] = 0;
```

```cpp
Union(r1, r2)
    if (rank[r1] > rank[r2])
        p[r2] = r1;
    else if (rank[r1] < rank[r2])
        p[r1] = r2;
    else
        p[r1] = r2;
        rank[r2] = rank[r1] + 1;
```
