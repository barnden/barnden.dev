## Applications
### Traversing the graph
```cpp
BFS(s)
1.  color[s] = gray; Q <- s;
2.  while (Q is not empty)
        w <- Q;
        for (each edge [w, v])
            if (color[v] == white)
                color[v] = gray; Q <- v;
            color[w] = black;

Main()
1.  for (each vertex v) color[v] = white;
2.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white)
            BFS(v)
```

```cpp
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray;
2.  for (each edge[v, w])
        if (color[w] == white)
            DFS(w);
3.  color[v] = black;

Main()
1.  for (each vertex v)
        color[v] = white;
2.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white)
            DFS(v)
```

Based on BFS and DFS, we can:
1. Test if a graph is connected
2. Test if a graph contains a cycle
3. Test if tree
4. Find shortest path in a graph (BFS)
5. Test if bipartite

## Bipartite Graphs

{% definition %}
Bipartite

A graph \\(G = (V, E)\\) is bipartite if its vertex set \\(V\\) can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets \\(V = R \cup B, R \cap B = \varnothing \\), such that every edge in G has one end in R and one end in B. In other words, the graph is 2-colorable.
