## Sorting Based on a (Max-)Heap
1. The root must be the largest
````
Heap: [ 24, 16, 10, 13, 12,  8,  2,  9,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  1]
 Out: [ - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - ]
```
2. Move the root to the end of the output
````
Heap: [ - , 16, 10, 13, 12,  8,  2,  9,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  1]
 Out: [ - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , 24]
```
3. Move the last leaf to root, the last leaf is no longer in heap, change heap size
````
Heap: [ 1 , 16, 10, 13, 12,  8,  2,  9,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  -]
 Out: [ - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , - , 24]
```
4. Notice that we can implement this using only one array, because there is now a blank at the end of the heap array.  

## Improved Sorting Based on a (Max-)Heap
Using our previous observation, we can imporve heapsort algorithm into an inplace algorithm.

**Note**: The heap size does not correlate to the size of the array of which the heap is based on.
1. The root must be the largest
```
Heap: [ 24, 16, 10, 13, 12,  8,  2,  9,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  1]
                                                                ^ t: 13
```
2. Swapping the root and the last leaf, decrease the heap size t by 1.
```
Heap: [ 1, 16, 10, 13, 12,  8,  2,  9,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  24]
                                                           ^ t: 12
```
3. The root value may not create a valid heap, use `FixHeap` to restore heap structure.
```
Heap: [ 16, 13, 10,  9, 12,  8,  2,  1,  8, 11, 12,  7,  5,  24]
                                                            ^ t: 12
```
4. Repeat steps 2-3

### Heapsort Pseudocode
```
SortHeap(H[0..n-1])
1. t = n-1
2. while(t > 0)
    H[1] <-> H[t]
    t = t-1
    FixHeap(H, t, 0)
```
### Complexity
`SortHeap` takes time O(\\(n \log n\\))

The advantage of this algorithm is that we can find the largest element very quickly.

## Making a (Max-)Heap given an array
1. A tree of a single node is a heap
2. Condition H: Given a root node with two children \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\). If both are heaps, then by FixHeap on node 0, we can make \\(T\\) a heap.

Notice that with this definition, we can apply the condition recursively in order to construct a full heap structure.
### Pseudocode
```
MakeHeap(H[0..n-1])
1. for (i = floor((n - 2) / 2); i >= 0; i--)
    FixHeapD(H, n-1, i)
```
Where `FixHeapD` only moves down along the root/leaf path, given by
```
FixHeapD(H, t, i)
1. h = 1
2. while (2h + 1 <= t)
    H[g] = max{H[2h + 1], H[2h + 2]}
    if (H[h] < H[g])
        H[h] <-> H[g]
        h = g
    else h = t
```

At first glance, MakeHeap is bounded above by \\(\mathcal{O}(n\log n)\\), however, we can observe:
- There are \\(\leq 2^{\log n - 1} = \frac{n}{2}\\) nodes of height 1, for each FixHeapD takes \\(\leq c\\) steps.
- There are \\(\leq \frac{n}{2^2}\\) nodes of height 2, on each of them, FixHeapD takes \\(\leq 2c\\) steps.
- There are \\(\leq \frac{n}{2^k}\\) nodes of height \\(k\\), on each of them, FixHeapD takes \\(\leq kc\\) steps.

Therefore, the total number of steps taken by MakeHeap is bounded above by \\(\mathcal{O}(n)\\).

Conclusion: HeapSort sorts an array of size \\(n\\) in time \\(\mathcal{O}(n\log n)\\).

## Summary
- FixHeapD takes \\(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\\)

    ```javascript
    FixHeapD(H, t, i)
    1. h = 1
    2. while (2h + 1 <= t)
        H[g] = max{H[2h + 1], H[2h + 2]}
        if (H[h] < H[g])
            H[h] <-> H[g]
            h = g
        else h = t
    ```

- MakeHeap takes \\(\mathcal{O}(n)\\)

    ```javascript
    MakeHeap(H[0..n-1])
    // make H[0..n-1] a heap
    1. for (i = floor((n - 2) / 2); i >= 0; i--)
        FixHeapD(H, n-1, i)
    ```

- SortHeap takes \\(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\\)

    ```javascript
    SortHeap(H[0..n-1])
    // H[0..n-1] is a heap
    1. t = n-1
    2. while (t > 0)
        H[0] <-> H[t]
        t = t - 1
        FixHeapD(H, t, 0)
    ```

- HeapSort takes \\(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\\)

    ```javascript
    HeapSort(H[0..n-1])
    // sort the array H[0..n-1]
    1. MakeHeap(H[0..n-1])
    2. SortHeap(H[0..n-1])
    ```
