## Heap Data Structure

{% definition %}
Heap

A (max-)heap is a complete binary tree (possibly a few rightmost leaves removed), such that the value in a node is not smaller than that of any of its children.
{% enddefinition %}

Heap representation

A heap can be given as an array such that the nodes are stored layer by layer from top to bottom. 
- Assuming the root node has index 0, a heap can be given by an array H[0..n-1], and an integer t.
- The children of node H[h] are H[2h + 1] and H[2h + 2]
- The parent of node H[h] is H\\(\left[\left\lfloor\frac{h-1}{2}\right\rfloor\right]\\)

The height of a heap of \\(n\\) nodes is \\(\leq \log_2n\\)

Therefore, traversing along a root/leaf path takes at most \\(\log_2n\\) steps
{% enddefinition %}

## Fix heap
Sps. we have heap (H, t), with a single wrong node at H[i], and we want to restore the heap structure.
```
FixHeap(H, t, i)
1.  h = i
2.  if (h != root && h > parent)
        while (h != root && h > parent)
            swap h <-> parent
    else
        while (h != leaf && h < largest_child)
            swap h <-> largest_child
```

We can tell if h is the root if \\(h = 1\\), and we can tell if h is a leaf if \\(2h + 1 > t\\).

### Time Complexity

The algorithm starts from a node in a heap, and follows a root/leaf path in the heap, and each move has time complexity of \\(O(1)\\).  
And takes \\(O(log n)\\).

### Rolling Down
```16 4 10 13 12 8 2 9 8 11 12 7```  
Notice that 4 is less than its children 13 and 12, we swap it with the larger child, 13.  
```16 13 10 4 12 8 2 9 8 11 12 7```  
Now, 4 is less than its children 9 and 8, again we swap with the larger child, 9.  
```16 13 10 9 12 8 2 4 8 11 12 7```

### Rolling Up
```16 24 10 13 12 8 2 9 8 11 12 7```  
Notice that 24 is greater than its parent 16, so we swap them.  
```24 16 10 13 12 8 2 9 8 11 12 7```

## Properties
- Not all sorted arrays are valid max-heaps
- All non-increasing arrays are max-heaps (assuming duplicates are allowed)
