## DFS on Directed Graphs

```
DFS(v)
1.  color[v] = gray;
2.  for (each arc [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white) DFS(w)
3.  color[v] = black; T[t] = v; t = t - 1;

main()
1.  for (each vertex v) color[v] = white;
2.  t = n;
3.  for (each vertex v)
        if (color[v] == white) DFS(v);
4.  Let G_r = reversed G;
5.  for (each vertex v in G_r)
        color[v] = white;
6.  scc# = 0;
7.  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        if (color[T[i]] == white)
            scc#++; DFS_r(T[i]);

DFS_r(v)
1.  color[v] = gray; SCC[v] = scc#;
2.  for (each arc [v, w])
        if (color[w] == white) DFS_r(w);
3.  color[v] = black;
```

Using adjacency lists, we can reverse the adjacency list in $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$

> Theorem: The strongly connected component problem (SCC) can be solved in time $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$
