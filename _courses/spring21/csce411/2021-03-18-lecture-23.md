## Bellman Ford
The SSSP problem is undefined for undirected graphs with negative edges, and for directed graphs with no negative cycles.

Why does Dijkstra make mistakes when there are negative edges?
- Dijkstra stops updating the value dist[v] after v becomes "in tree".

If we continue updating the value of dist[v] even after v is "in tree", whenever an improvement is achieved, would that correct Dijkstra's?
- Yes, we get the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

```c++
BellmanFord(G, s, t)
1.  for (v = 1; v <= n; v++)
        dist[v] = infty
2.  dist[s] = 0;
3.  loop (n - 1 times)
        for (each edge [v, w])
            if (dist[w] > dist[v] + weight(v, w))
                parent[w] = v;
                dist[w] = dist[v] + weight(v, w);
4.  for (each edge [v, w])
        if (dist[w] > dist[v] + weight(v, w))
            Stop("Negative Cycle")
5.  output parent[1..n]
```

Theorem. If there is no negative cycles in the graph G, then for a vertex v to which a shortest path from s consists for k edges, after at most k iterations of step 3, dist[v] becomes the length of the shortest path from s to v.

Why is step 4 correct?
- If there are no negative cycles, for every vertex v, there is a shortest path from s to v. So after n-1 iterations in step 3, all vertices v get their correct value dist[v], therefore, improvement in step 4 is impossible.

### Complexity
$$\mathcal{O}(nm)$$, step 3 outer loop is order $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$, inner loop is $$\mathcal{O}(m)$$.
