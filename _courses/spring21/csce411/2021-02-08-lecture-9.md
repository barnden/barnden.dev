## Counting Sort
- Assumption: We know in advance that all elements in the input array $$A[0..n-1]$$ are integers between $$0$$ and $$k - 1$$, where $$k$$ is not too large.
  - Elements in A may have multiple copies.
- Idea: For each element $$A[i]$$, count the number $$h_i$$ of elements in $$A[0..n-1]$$ that are not larger than $$A[i]$$ (so $$A[i]$$ should be placed in the $$h_i$$<sup>th</sup> position in the output).
- Process:
  1. For each value $$v$$, count the number of copies of $$v \in A[0..n-1]$$
  2. For each $$A[i]$$, count the number of elements in $$A[0..n-1]$$ that are not larger than $$A[i]$$
  3. Use the information in step 2 to output a sorted list.
- Pseudocode Implementation

  ```cpp
  // Assumptions: input of an array A with n elements
  //     we know k, array C with k elements defined.

  // Step 1
  for (h = 0; h < k; h++) C[h] = 0;
  for (h = 0; h < n; h++) ++C[A[h]];

  // Step 2
  for (h = 1; h < k; h++) C[h] += C[h-1];

  // Step 3
  for (h = n - 1; h >= 0; h--)
    C[A[h]] = C[A[h]] - 1;
    B[C[A[h]]] = A[h];
  ```

In the 3<sup>rd</sup> step, the implementation differs from the textbook, as we assume that array indicies start from zero, rather than one inside the text. If arrays start from one, then swap the instructions in the for loop in step 3.

### Time complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is $$\mathcal{O}(n + k)$$, therefore, counting sort can faster if $$k$$ is relatively small.

### Stability
Counting sort is stable, because it keeps the relative positions for elements of the same value.
