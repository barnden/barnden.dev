## Linear-Time Sorting Algorithms
- Counting Sort
  - Assumption: We know in advance that all elements in the input array \\(A[0..n-1]\\) are integers between \\(0\\) and \\(k - 1\\), where \\(k\\) is not too large.
    - Elements in A may have multiple copies.
  - Idea: For each element \\(A[i]\\), count the number \\(h_i\\) of elements in \\(A[0..n-1]\\) that are not larger than \\(A[i]\\) (so \\(A[i]\\) should be placed in the \\(h_i\\)<sup>th</sup> position in the output).
  - Process:
    1. For each value \\(v\\), count the number of copies of \\(v \in A[0..n-1]\\)
    2. For each \\(A[i]\\), count the number of elements in \\(A[0..n-1]\\) that are not larger than \\(A[i]\\)
    3. Use the information in step 2 to output a sorted list.
  - Pseudocode Implementation

    ```cpp
    // Assumptions: input of an array A with n elements
    //     we know k, array C with k elements defined.
    for (h = 0; h < k; h++) C[h] = 0;
    for (h = 0; h < n; h++) ++C[A[h]];
    for (h = 1; h < k; h++) C[h] += C[h-1];
    ```
