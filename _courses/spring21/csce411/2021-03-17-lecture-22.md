## Improvements
Use a min-heap to store the fringes.
1.  `RetrieveMin(H)`: finding the min and restoring the heap: \\(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\\).
2.  `Insert(H, v)`: add new fringe and restoring the heap: \\(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\\).
3.  `Delete(H, v)`: delete v and restore heap: \\(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\\).

```cpp
Dijkstra(G, s, t)                       // O((n + m) log n)
1.  for (each vertex v)                 // O(n)
        status[v] = unseen;
2.  status[s] = in_tree;                // O(1)
    dist[s] = 0;
    H = empty heap;
3.  for (each edge [s, w])              // O(n log n)
        status[w] = fringe;
        dist[w] = weight(s, w);
        Insert(H, w);
        parent[w] = s;
4.  while (there exists fringes)        // < n times
4.1     v = RetrieveMin(H);             // O(log n)
4.2     status[v] = in tree;            // O(1)
4.3     for (each edge [v, w])          // separate
4.3.1       if (status[w] == unseen)    // O(1)
                status[w] = fringe;
                parent[w] = v;
                dist[w] = dist[v] + weight(v, w);
                Insert(H, w);
4.3.2       else if (                   // O(log n)
                status[w] == fringe &&
                dist[w] > dist[v] + weight(v, w)
            )   Delete(H, w);
                parent[w] = v;
                dist[w] = dist[v] + weight(v, w);
                Insert(H, w);
5.  output parent[1..n];
```

## Why is Dijkstra's correct?
Assuming positive edge weights.

> Theorem: When a vertex \\(v\\) becomes "in-tree", the value `dist[v]` is the shortest path from \\(s \to v\\), given in the tree.

Proof: By induction on the number \\(k\\) of "in-tree" vertices.

k = 1: s is the only "in-tree" vertex, `dist[s] = 0`.

Assume the theorem is true for \\(k - 1\\).

Let \\(v\\) be the \\(k\\)<sup>th</sup> "in-tree".

## Time Complexity

> Theorem: On graphs whose edge weights are all non-negative, Dijkstra's algorithm solves the shortest path problem in time \\(\mathcal{O}(m\log n)\\) or \\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\).

### Discussion
1. How do we ensure that Dijkstra's algorithm solves the problem in time not larger than the smaller of \\(\mathcal{O}(m\log n)\\) or \\(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\)?
   - We use 2 computers and take whatever finishes first.
   - We use 1 computer and run both, and stop the other when one finishes.
   - Compute \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), see if \\(m\log n > n^2\\) and pick accordingly.
2. Dijkstra's algorithm is independent of the vertex \\(t\\). It finds the shortest path from \\(s\\) to EVERY vertex that is reachable from \\(s\\), this solves the SSSP problem.
3. How do we find the actual shortest path from \\(s\\) to a vertex using the output of Dijkstra's algorithm (i.e., the parent array)?
4. Dijkstra's can be incorrect if there are negative edges.
