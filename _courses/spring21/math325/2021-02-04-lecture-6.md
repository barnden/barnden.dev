## ยง 2.3: Forces of Interest
A fundamental principal in the theory of interest is that the value of an amt. of money at any given point in time upon the time elapsed since the money was paid in the past or upon the time which will elapse in the future before it is paid.

Thus, two or more amts. of money payabel at diff. pts. in time cannot be compared until all amts. are acc. or discounted to a common date, i.e. **comparison date**.

The eqn. which acc. or discounts each payment to the comp. date is called the eqn. of val.
- For compound interest, the choice of comp. date makes no diff. in the ans. obtained. There is a diff. eqn. of val. for each comp. date.
- For simp. interest/discount, the choice of comp. date does not affect the ans. obtained.

{% example %}
2.3.1

In return for a promise to receive $600 at the end of 8 yrs, a person agrees to pay $100 at once, $200 at the end of 5 years, and a payment at 10 years. Find the payment at 10 years if the nom. rate is 8% convertible semiannually.

a) Solve using comp. date of 0

$$
\begin{align}
100+200v^5+xv^10&=600v^8\\
x &= \frac{600v^16-100-200v^10}{v^20} = 186.75
\end{align}
$$

b) Solve using eqn. of val. at \\(t = 10\\).

$$
100(1.04)^{20} + 200(1.04)^{10} + x = 600(1.04)^4
$$

c) Solve using eqn. of val. at \\(t = 8\\).

$$
100(1.04)^{16} + 200(1.04)^{6} + xv^4 = 600
$$

{% example %}
2.3.2

Find the amt. to be paid at the end of 8 yrs. which is equivalent to two payments of $200 each, the first paid immediately, the second after 5 yrs. Asm. 7% simp. interest is earned from the date of each payment is made and use a comp. date of:

a) the end of 8 yrs.

$$
200(1 + .07(8)) + 200(1 + .07(3)) = x = \$554
$$

b) the end of 12 yrs.

$$
200(1 + .07(12)) + 200(1 + .07(7)) = x(1 + .07(4)) \implies x = \$520.31
$$

## ยง 2.4: Unknown time

{% example %}
2.4.1

Find the length of time necessary for $500 to accumulate to $2 000 if invested at a nominal rate of 7% compounded quarterly.

$$
\begin{align}
500\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^{4t} &= 2000\\
\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^{4t}&=4\\
t&=\frac{\ln(4)}{4\ln\left(1+\frac{.07}{4}\right)}\\
&= 19.9769\ \text{years}
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
2.4.2

Payments of $100, $200, and $500 are due at the end of years 2, 3, and 8 respectively. Asm. an eff. rate of interest of 5% per annum, find the point in time at which a payment of $800 would be equivalent.

$$
\begin{align}
v &= (1.05)^{-1}\\
100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8 &= 800 v^n\\
v^n &= \frac{1}{800}\left[100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8\right]\\
n &= \log_v\left(\frac{1}{800}\left[100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8\right]\right)\\
&= 5.8318\ \text{yrs}
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
2.4.3

Payments of $100, $200, and $500 are due at the end of years 2, 3, and 8 respectively. Asm. an eff. rate of interest of 5% per annum, find the point in time at which a payment of $800 would be equivalent using the method of equated time.

$$
\bar{t} = \frac{100(2) + 200(3) + 500(8)}{800} \approx 6\ \text{yrs.}
$$

Note that \\(\bar{t}\\) is always greater than the actual time.

## 2.5 Unknown Rate of Interest

{% example %}
2.5.1

Find the nominal rate of interest compounded monthy s.t. the acc. val. of $400 will be $600 in 4 years.

$$
\begin{align}
400\left(1 + \frac{i^{(12)}}{12}\right)^{12(4)} &= 600\\
i^{(12)} &= 10.17956\%
\end{align}
$$

Note you can find the eff. rate of interest, then convert to the one the question asked for.
