## 2.4 Unknown time

{% example %}
2.4.1

Find the length of time necessary for $500 to accumulate to $2 000 if invested at a nominal rate of 7% compounded quarterly.

$$
\begin{align}
500\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^{4t} &= 2000\\
\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^{4t}&=4\\
t&=\frac{\ln(4)}{4\ln\left(1+\frac{.07}{4}\right)}\\
&= 19.9769\ \text{years}
\end{align}
$$

{% example %}
2.4.2

Payments of $100, $200, and $500 are due at the end of years 2, 3, and 8 respectively. Asm. an eff. rate of interest of 5% per annum, find the point in time at which a payment of $800 would be equivalent.

$$
\begin{align}
v &= (1.05)^{-1}\\
100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8 &= 800 v^n\\
v^n &= \frac{1}{800}\left[100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8\right]\\
n &= \log_v\left(\frac{1}{800}\left[100v^2 + 200v^3 + 500v^8\right]\right)\\
&= 5.8318\ \text{yrs}
\end{align}
$$

{% example %}
2.4.3

Payments of $100, $200, and $500 are due at the end of years 2, 3, and 8 respectively. Asm. an eff. rate of interest of 5% per annum, find the point in time at which a payment of $800 would be equivalent using the method of equated time.

$$
\bar{t} = \frac{100(2) + 200(3) + 500(8)}{800} \approx 6\ \text{yrs.}
$$

Note that \\(\bar{t}\\) is always greater than the actual time.

## 2.5 Unknown Rate of Interest

{% example %}
2.5.1

Find the nominal rate of interest compounded monthy s.t. the acc. val. of $400 will be $600 in 4 years.

$$
\begin{align}
400\left(1 + \frac{i^{(12)}}{12}\right)^{12(4)} &= 600\\
i^{(12)} &= 10.17956\%
\end{align}
$$

Note you can find the eff. rate of interest, then convert to the one the question asked for.
