## ยง 1.7: Effective Rate of Discount (cont)

### The relationship between \\(d\\) and \\(i\\)

**Note**: The following is only valid for compound discount/interest, **not** for simple discount/interest (unless the number of periods is one).

- Concept of equivalency: Two rates of interest or discounts are said to be equivalent iff a given amount of principal invested for the same length of time at each of the rates produces the amount accumulated value.

$$
\begin{array}{l l}
    i_n = \frac{I_n}{A(n - 1)} & d_1 = \frac{I_1}{A(1)}\\
    i = \frac{I_1}{A(0)} & d = \frac{i}{1 + i}\\
    = \frac{d}{1 - d}
\end{array}
$$

Then, we get the following:
- \\((1-d)(1+i) = 1\\) (solve for the letter you want)
- \\(d = \frac{i}{1 + i} = iv\\)

### Simple Discount
The amount of discount earned each period is constant, for an annual simple rate of discount, \\(d\\):
- The PV of a payment of $1 to be made in \\(t\\) years is \\(1 - dt\\)
- The acc. val. after \\(t\\) years of a deposit of $1 is \\((1 - dt)^{-1}\\)

{% example %}
1.7.3

What is the PV of $1 000 due in 10 days at asimple daily discount rate of 10%?

\\[
1000 (1 - (10)10) = 0
\\]
{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.7.4

An investment of $10 000 is made into a fund at time \\(t = 0\\). The fund develops the following balances over the next 2 years. Compute the eff. rate of discount for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year.

| \\(t\\) | \\(A(t)\\) | \\(I_n\\) | \\(0_n\\)
| --- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | 10 000 |       |       |
| 1   | 10 600 | \\(I_1\\) = 600 | \\(i_1 = 6\%\\) |
| 2   | 11 024 | \\(I_2\\) = 424 | \\(i_2 = 4\%\\) |

\\[
d_2 = \frac{i_2}{i + i_2} = \frac{.04}{1.04} = 3.846\%
\\]

\\[
d_2 = \frac{I_2}{A_2} = \frac{424}{11024} = 3.846\%
\\]

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.7.5

Find the acc. val. of $1 000 at the end of 7 years and 5 mo. invested at an eff. rate of discount of 4% sps. simple discount in fractional period.

\\[
1000(1 - .04)^{-7}(1 - .04\left(\frac{5}{12}\right))^{-1} = \$1353.32

## ยง 1.8: Nominal Rate of Interest and Discounts

{% definition %}
Nominal rates

The term **effective** is used for rates of interest and discounts in which interest is paid once per measurement period.

**Nominal** rates are when interest is paid more frequently than once per measurement period.

Examples:
- 5% compounded quarterly
- 6% payable monthly
- 3% convertable semiannually
{% enddefinition %}

### Nominal Rate of Interest

The **interest conversion period** is the frequency with which interest is paid and reinstated to earn additional interest.

The **nominal rate of interest** payable \\(m\\) times per period (typically a year) is denoted by \\(i^{(m)}\\). The rate of interest for each \\(m\\)<sup>th</sup> of a period (eff. rate per period) is \\(\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\\).

8% per yr. comp. quarterly -> \\(\frac{8\%}{4} = 2\%\\) per quarter (eff. rate per quarter)

We have that:

$$
1 + i = \left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m
$$

| \\(i = \left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m - 1\\) | \\(i^{(m)} = m\left[(1 + i)^{1/m} - 1\right]\\) |

{% example %}
1.8.1

What is the ann. eff. rate of int. for an acct. w/nom. rate of 5% comp. quarterly?

5% comp. quarterly \\(\implies i^{(4)} = .05\\).

$$
\begin{align}
i &= \left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m - 1\\
&= \left(1 + \frac{.05}{4}\right) - 1\\
&= 5.0945\%.
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.8.2

If \\(i^{(4)} = 7\%\\), find the equiv. rate of \\(i^{(6)}\\).

$$
\begin{align}
\left(1 + \frac{i^{(4)}}{4}\right)^4 &= 1 + i = \left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^6\\
\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^4 &= \left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^6\\
6\left[\left(1 + \frac{.07}{4}\right)^{4/6} - 1\right] &= i^{(6)} \implies 6.9797\%.
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.8.3

Find the FV of $200 invested for 5 yrs. at 8% per annum convertable quarterly.

\\(i^{(4)} = 8\%\\)

$$
200\left(1 + \frac{.08}{4}\right)^{4(5)} = \$297.19.
$$

{% endexample %}

### Nominal Rate of Discount

Denoted as \\(d^{(m)}\\), the rate of discount for each \\(m\\)<sup>th</sup> of a period is \\(\frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\\).

The PV of a payment of $1 to be made at the end of a year is found by \\(1 - d = \left(1 - \frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m\\)

$$
\left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m = \left(1 - \frac{d^{(p)}}{p}\right)^{-p}
$$

{% example %}
1.8.4

If \\(i^{(6)} = 3.4\%\\), find \\(d^{(12)}\\)

$$
\begin{align}
\left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^6 &= \left(1 - \frac{d^{(12)}}{12}\right)^{-12}\\
1 - \frac{d^{(12)}}{12} &= \left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^{-6/12}\\
1 - \left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^{-6/12} &= \frac{d^{(12)}}{12}\\
d^{(12)} &= 12 \left[1 - \left(1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}\right)^{-6/12}\right]\\
&= 3.3856\%
\end{align}
$$

Finding \\(d^{(6)}\\):

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d^{(6)}}{6} &= \frac{\frac{i^{(6)}}{6}}{1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}}\\
d^{(6)} &= 6 \left[\frac{\frac{i^{(6)}}{6}}{1 + \frac{i^{(6)}}{6}}\right]\\
&= 3.3808\%
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.8.5

Find the PV of $7 000 paid at the end of 5 yrs. at 6% per yr. payable in advance, convertible semimonthly.

\\(d^{(24)} = 6\%\\)

$$
7000(1 - \frac{.06}{24})^{24(5)} = \$5183.78
$$
