## § 1.9: Forces of Interest

- **Effective rates of interest**: \\(i\\) measure interest over one measurement period.
- **Nominal rates of interest**: \\(i^{(m)}\\) measure interest over \\(m\\)<sup>ths</sup> of a measurement period.
- **Forces of interest**: \\(\delta_t\\) measure interest over infinitesimally small intervals of time.

Sps. \\(A(t)\\) represents the amt. func. of an investment at time \\(t\\) where \\(t\\) is measured in years. Consider \\(A(t)\\) over the interval \\(\left[t,t+\frac{1}{m}\right]\\). Assume that we have nominal rate \\(i^{(m)}\\) for this interval.

$$
\begin{align}
A(t) + \frac{1}{m} &= A(t)\left[1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right]\\
\frac{A(t + \frac{1}{m})}{A(t)} &= 1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\\
\frac{i^{(m)}}{m} &= \frac{A\left(t + \frac{1}{m}\right)}{A(t)} - 1\\
i^{(m)} &= m\left[\frac{A\left(t + \frac{1}{m}\right) - A(t)}{A(t)}\right]\\
&= \frac{1}{A(t)}\left[\frac{A\left(t + \frac{1}{m}\right)  - A(t)}{\frac{1}{m}}\right]\\
\delta_t &= \lim_{m\to\infty}i^{(m)}\\
&= \frac{1}{A(t)}\lim_{m\to\infty}\left[\frac{A\left(t + \frac{1}{m}\right) - A(t)}{\frac{1}{m}}\right]\\
&= \frac{A'(t)}{A(t)}
\end{align}
$$

{% definition %}
Force of Interest

For an investment that grows according to an acc. amt. func. \\(A(t)\\), the **force of interest at time \\(t\\)** is defined as

$$
\delta_t = \frac{A'(t)}{A(t)} = \frac{a'(t)}{a(t)} = \frac{d}{dt}\ln\left(A(t)\right) = \frac{d}{dt}\ln\left(a(t)\right)
$$

\\(\delta_t\\) is a nominal annual interest rate compounded infinitely often, or compounded continuously. \\(\delta_t\\) is also interpreted as the instantaneous rate of growth of the investment per dollar invested a time point \\(t\\).
{% enddefinition %}

{% example %}
1.9.1

Consider the amt. func. \\(A(t) = 25\left(1 + \frac{t}{4}\right)^3\\). At what time is the force of interest equal to 0.5?

$$
\begin{align}
\delta_t &= \frac{A'(t)}{A(t)} = \frac{75(1 + \frac{t}{4})^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{25\left(1 + \frac{t}{4}\right)^3}\\
&= \frac{3}{4\left(1 + \frac{t}{4}\right)} = \frac{3}{4 + t}
\end{align}
$$

So, \\(.5 = \frac{3}{4 + t} \implies t = 2\ \text{yrs.}\\)

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.9.2

A fund's value at time \\(t\\) is given by \\(A(t) = 7t^2 + 3t + 75\\), find \\(\delta_2\\).

$$
\delta_t = \frac{A'(2)}{A(2)} = \frac{28 + 3}{7(4) + 3(2) + 75} = 28.404\%
$$

{% endexample %}

Consider for \\(t_1\le t_2\\):

$$
    \begin{align}
    &\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta_r\,dr\\
    =\ &\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\frac{d}{dr}\ln\left(A(r)\right)\,dr\\
    =\ &\ln\left(A(r)\right)\Big|_{t_1}^{t_2}\\
    =\ &\ln\left(\frac{A(t_2)}{A(t_1)}\right)
    \end{align}
$$

$$
    \begin{align}
    e^{\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta_r\,dr} &= \frac{A(t_2)}{A(t_1)}\\
    A(t_2) &= A(t_1)e^{\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta_r\,dr}
    \end{align}
$$

So, \\(e^{\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta_r\,dr}\\) accumulates \\(A(t_1)\\) to \\(A(t_2)\\) from time \\(t_1\\) to time \\(t_2\\).

Conversely,

$$
A(t_1) = A(t_2)e^{-\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\delta_r\,dr}
$$

Special case when \\(t_1 = 0, t_2 = t\\):

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{0}^{t}\delta_r\,dr &= \ln\left(\frac{A(t)}{A(0)}\right)\\
a(t) &= e^{\int_0^t\delta_r\,dr}\\
A(t) &= A(t)e^{-\int_{0}^{t}\delta_r\,dr}
\end{align}
$$

{% example %}
1.9.3

An investment of $500 accumulates at a force of interest of \\(\delta_t = 0.2-0.02t\\).

$$
\begin{align}
\int_0^t \delta_r\,dr &= \int_0^t\left(.2 - .02r\right)\,dr\\
&=\left(.2r - .01r^2\right)\Big|_0^t\\
&= .2t - .01t^2
\end{align}
$$

a) Find \\(A(3)\\).

$$
\begin{align}
A(3) &= A(0)e^{\int_0^3\delta_r\,dr}\\
&= 500 e^{.2(3)-.01(3)^2}\\
&= 500 e^{.51}\\
&= 832.65
\end{align}
$$

b) Find the interest earned between times 2 and 4.

$$
\begin{align}
A(4) - A(2) &= 500e^{\int_0^4\delta_r\,dr} - 500e^{\int_0^2\delta_r\,dr}\\
&= 231.58
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.9.4

Using a force of interest of \\(\delta_t = 0.1 - 0.002t\\), find the value of the account at the end of the third year, if the account has a value of $200 at the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> year.

$$
\begin{align}
A(8)&=A(3)e^{\int_3^8(.1+.002r)\,dr}\\
A(3)&=A(8)e^{-\left[.1r-.001r^{2}\right]_3^8}\\
&=200e^{-\left[.1(8)-.001(64)-(.1(3)-.001(9))\right]}\\
&=128.16
\end{align}
$$

{% endexample %}

Derive an expression for \\(\delta_t\\) based on

a) simple interest at annual rate \\(i\\)

$$
\delta_t=\frac{d}{dt}\ln(a(t)) =\frac{d}{dy}\ln(1 + it) =\frac{i}{1+it}
$$

b) compound interest at annual rate \\(i\\)

$$
\delta_t = \frac{d}{dt}\ln(1 + i)^t =\frac{(1+i)^t\ln(1+i)}{(1+i)^t} = \ln(1 + i)
$$

If \\(i\\) is constant, then \\(\delta_t=\delta\\) is a constant.

\\(\delta = \ln(1 + i) \iff (1+i) = e^\delta\\)

Which means, \\(A(t) = A(0)(1+i)^t = A(0)e^{\delta t}\\) (continuous interest formula)

### Force of Discount

Define \\(\delta_t'\\) as force of discount, let \\(A(t)\\) be an amt. func. and \\(d^{(m)}\\) a nom. dis. rate on the interval of \\(\left[t,t+\frac{1}{m}\right]\\).

$$
A\left(t + \frac{1}{m}\right) = A(t)\cdot\left(1 - \frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{-1}
$$

Solving for \\(d^{(m)}\\) and taking the limit as \\(m \to \infty\\) gives

$$
\delta_t' = \frac{-\frac{d}{dt}(A(t))^{-1}}{(A(t))^{-1}} = \dots = \frac{a'(t)}{a(t)} = \delta_t
$$

**Note**: For simple interest,

| Force of Interest | Force of Discount |
| - | - |
| \\(\delta_t = \frac{i}{1 + it}\\) | \\(\delta_t' = \frac{d}{1 - dt}\\) |

### Relationship of Terms

$$
\left(1 + \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^m = (1 + i) = v^{-1} = (1 - d)^{-1} = \left(1 - \frac{d^{p}}{p}\right)^{-p} = e^{\delta}
$$

## § 1.10: Varying Interest

{% example %}
1.10.1

Find the acc. val. of $1 000 at the end of 15 yrs. if the acct. has an eff. rate of interest of 4% for the first 3 yrs., a nom. rate of 8% comp. monthly for 3 years, a nom. rate of 6% comp. quarterly for 4 yrs, an eff. rate of discount of 10% for 2 yrs, and a force of interest of 3% for 3 yrs.

$$
1000(1.04)^3\left(1 + \frac{.06}{4}\right)^{16}(1 - .10)^{-2}e^{.03(3)} = \$2449.31
$$
{% endexample %}

{% example %}
1.10.2

Find the equiv. lvl. eff. rate of interest over the 15 yr period for 1.10.1 above.

$$
\begin{align}
1000(1 + i)^{15} &= 2449.31\\
i &= 6.15397\%
\end{align}
$$
{% endexample %}

## § 9.4: Inflation and Real Rate of Return

{% definition %}
Inflation

**Inflation** is defined as a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services, i.e. loss of purchasing power.
{% enddefinition %}

Sps. you have $100 and the price of milk is $4/gal., so $100 gets 25 gal.

Assume you invest $100 for 2 yrs. at eff. rate of 8% per year. In 2 yrs, you have abt. $116.64. You should be able to buy \\(116.64/4 \approx 29\\) gal. of milk, asum. no infl. (i.e. price of milk still $4/gal).

Sps. that there was a 5% const. rate of infl. over these 2 yrs. This implies that milk now costs \\(4(1.05)^2 = \$4.41\\)/gal, therefore you can only buy \\(116.64/4.41 \approx 26\\) gal. of milk.

The purchasing power grew from 25 to 26.45 gal. over the 2 yr. pd. Then, the **real rate of return**, \\(i'\\), is measured by solving the following eq.

$$
25(1 + i')^2 = 26.44898
$$

In this example, \\(i'\\) is 2.857%. (Note: the real rate of return is NOT the difference between rate of interest earned and the rate of infl.)

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{PV of Money}}{\text{Cur. price/item}}\cdot(1 + i')^2 &= \frac{\text{FV of money}}{\text{Future price/item}}\\
(i + i')^2 &= \frac{(1 + i)^2}{(1 + r)^2}\\
1 + i' &= \frac{1 + i}{1 + 4}\\
i' &= \frac{i - r}{1 + r}
\end{align}
$$

where \\(i'\\) is real rate of return, \\(i\\) is annual eff. rate of interest, and \\(r\\) is rate of inflation.

{% example %}
9.4.1

The annual eff. int. rate is 8% and rate of infl. is 2%. Det. real int. rate.

$$
i' = \frac{i - r}{1 + r} = \frac{.08 - .02}{1.01} = 5.8824\%
$$
{% endexample %}

{% example %}
9.4.2

Bob's acct. has an ann. eff. rate of 10% on which 30% tax is paid, if infl. is 6% per year, what is the ann. after-tax real rate of return?

For every $1 invested, we get 10¢ interest, after taxes that becomes 7¢.

$$
1 + i' = \frac{1+i}{1+r} = \frac{1.07}{1.06} = 1.00943396 = 1 + i'
$$

Then, \\(i' = .943396\%\\)

## § 2.2: The Basic Problem

An interest problem involves four basic quantities
- The principal originally invested
- The length of the investment period
- The rate (or force) of interest (or discount)
- The acc. val. of the principal at the end of the investment pd.

Observations:
- The length of the investment pd. is measured in time units, usually one year. However, if nom. rates of interest/discounts are involved, the most convenient time unit is the interest conversion pd (usually).
- The **yield rate** is teh rate of interest which will establish an equivalency of value between a financial value at one point in time, and a financial value at a different point in time.  
i.e. at time \\(t = 0\\) $100 is equivalent in value to $110 at time \\(t = 1\\), iff the yield rate is 10%
- An interest problem can be viewed from two perspectives, the borrower and the lender.
- In practical applications, the terminology can become confusing and inconsistent (ensure you understand the exact nature of transaction).
